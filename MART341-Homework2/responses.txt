d1. How is the world wide web different than the internet? - I hear an analogy in another class that makes it easier for someone like me to understand; A movie theatre would be comparble to the world wide web, where you watch a movie (or visit a web page). How you actually GET to the theater is where the internet comes in.
The world wide web is a virtual space where content is stored and accessed, and the internet keeps it all connected.
2. Briefly describe how the internet works. - The internet is a virtual space where people can connect and store and/or collect data using unique IP addresses.
3. What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files? - I could honestly never see a differences between the two, but I have only heard the term directory when discussing coding. They both seem to serve the same purpose: keep your files organized. 
4. How will VCS benefit you? - I like VCS because is often helps you identify coding issues as they happen, and it has the tools to help keep my code organized. VCS 
will also allow me to better track my progress, as I can review older versions of projects and even revert back to said older versions if I choose to do so.
5. What is your favorite kind of art? - Music, by a mile. I have been playing for years, but am still very new to writing and recording my own material. Working on it, though!
