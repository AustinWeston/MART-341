1. How is the world wide web different than the internet? - I once heard someone define the difference between the Internet and the world wide web with an analogy that I really
liked; A movie theatre would be comparble to the world wide web, where you watch a movie (or visit a web page). How you actually GET to the theater is where the internet comes in.
The world wide web is a virtual space where content is stored and accessed, and the internet keeps it all connected.
2. Briefly describe how the internet works. - The internet allows individuals to connect to a virtual space to store and access data. Data is sent and retreived with unique IP
addresses through wireless routers and remote servers.
3. What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files? - There are virtually no differences between the two, but directory is commonly used when discussing file systems.
They both seem to serve the same purpose: keep your files organized.
4. How will VCS benefit you? - VCS will be great for the carona period considering that it makes it easier for students and professors to share their work with one another. VCS 
will also allow me to better track my progress, as I can review older versions of projects and even revert back to said older versions if I choose to do so.
5. What is your favorite kind of art? - Music, by a mile. I have been playing for years, but only recently just started to write and record. It has been a fun way to express myself,
and I wish I had started writing music much sooner.
