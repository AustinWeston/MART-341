Austin Cook

Week 2: We got our Github accounts and repositories ready to rock and roll for the semester. No trouble with anything this week, really. The only thing was I had to google 
how to make a directory in a repository, and I learned that a little / solves all of your problems!

Whoops, I have not been updating this...

Week 7: We learned about forms and various input methods!

Week 8: This week was all about divs, classes, Ids, spans and Iframe embedding
