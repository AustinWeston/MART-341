Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve? - The most commonly used form has to be the Google search engine, which collects data with a text input and directs you to a page of links that relate to the text that was put into the search engine.

List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage. - Payment information forms use text input to collect payment information from indivuals, typically when they buy something online. These forms usually have restrictions in place for birthdates, credit card numbers, etcetera. Radio buttons are commonly used in online quizzes and questionnaires, where you can only select one option. If you want to be able to select more than one, you can use the "checkbox" input. Buttons are used to direct users to another page when they are clicked, and they are on just about every website you can think of. The google search button is a good example.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. - I looked over the course material yesterday and let that information digest overnight. The next morning, I was able to assemble this weeks site pretty easily. It took me a second to understand the concept of forms and using them to collect data, but after going over that portion of the course material once more, I have a better understanding of it. I am definitely looking forward to becoming more familiar with forms and back-end coding in the future.
