1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
	-It took me a minute to understand div tags and how they are used, but I think I have a good understanding of them now.
	I am sure that I will be more more comfortabe with them when I use them more, especially with css.

2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
	-I did get to experiment a bit with css in your mobile development course, so I have been looking forward to delving into it again!

3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to overcome your challenges?
	-I feel like I could have come up with a better instructable. I know that it isn't the best, but I still feel like I now have a better understanding of this weeks material
	after this assignment. I spent a little extra time learning about divs and classes by reviewing course material and watching a few videos on youtube. 
	I also struggled with expanding the text box on the contact page, but it turned out to be a simple typo fix. I just had to stare at the code for a few minutes to figure it out!
