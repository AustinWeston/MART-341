1. How is the world wide web different than the internet? - I once heard someone define the difference between the Internet and the world wide web with an analogy that I really
liked; A movie theatre would be comparble to the world wide web, where you watch a movie (or visit a web page). How you actually GET to the theater is where the internet comes in.
The world wide web is a virtual space where content is stored and accessed, and the internet keeps it all connected.

2. Briefly describe how the internet works. - The internet allows individuals to connect to a virtual space to store and access data. Data is sent and retreived with unique IP
addresses through wireless routers and remote servers.

3. Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet? - Data is broken down into packets of binary code and transferred in pieces via a network of fiber optical cables.

4. What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS? - DNS and IP addresses directly correlate with one and another just name names and numbers in a phone book. 
We use DNS because they are easier to remember than the random numbers of an IP address. 

5. What is a cookie? - Cookies are small text files that collect and store personal details for websites, such as settings, preferences, and log-in information.

6. List the three essential parts of a URL. - The protocol, the domain name, and the path.
