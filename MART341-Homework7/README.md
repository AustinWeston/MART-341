List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage. - Payment information forms use text input to collect payment information from indivuals, typically when they buy something online. These forms usually have restrictions in place for birthdates, credit card numbers, etcetera. Radio buttons are commonly used in online quizzes and questionnaires, where you can only select one option. If you want to be able to select more than one, you can use the "checkbox" input. Buttons are used to direct users to another page when they are clicked, and they are on just about every website you can think of. The google search button is a good example.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. - I retained pretty much all of the material from last semester, so I had no issues. It also helped to have my previous assignment to use as a reference, but I honestly didn't really have to.
