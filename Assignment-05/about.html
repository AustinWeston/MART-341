    <p>
        Jon Scieszta is an American children's writer, who has written over a dozen childrens books over the last three 
        decades. The one that I am most familiar with is "The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales", which contains one 
        of my favorite satirical short stories: "The Really Ugly Duckling". I have vague memories of mmy mother reading the stories from
        that book to me, and I remember that we laughed really hard together at the silly and abrupt ending to "The Really Ugly Duckling".
        I have Mr. Scieszta to thank for those memories!
