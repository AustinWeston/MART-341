          <h1>The Really Ugly Duckling</h1>

          <hr />

     <p>Once upon a time there was a mother duck and a father duck who had seven baby ducklings. 
        Six of them where regular-looking ducklings. The seventh was a really ugly duckling.
        Everyone used to say: "What a nice-looking bunch of ducklings - all expect that one. Boy, he's really ugly."
        The really ugly duckling heard these people, but he didn't care. He knew that one day he would probably grow 
        up to be a swan and be bigger and look better than anything in the pond.
        Well, as it turned out, he was just a really ugly duckling.
        And he grew up to be a really ugly duck.
        The end.</p>
