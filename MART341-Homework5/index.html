     <p>I wanted to keep some frogs in the bathtub but Mom wouldn't let me. I was so mad. <br>
        I wanted to play with my little sister"s doll house but Dad wouldn't let me. I was so mad.<br>
        I wanted to play hide-and-seek in the clean sheets but Grandma said, "No, you can't". I was just so mad.<br>
        I wanted to water the garden but Grandpa said, "No, you can't".<br>
        So I decided to decorate the house but Grandpa said, "No, you can't do that either". Was I ever mad.<br>
        Dad said, "Why don't you play in the sandbox?". I didn't want to do that.<br>
        Mom said, "Why don't you play on the slide?". I didn't want to do that, either. I was too mad.<br>
        I wanted to practice my juggling show, instead. But mom said, "No, you can't"<br>
        I wanted to tickle the goldfish but Mom said, "Leave the goldfish alone"<br>
        "Youd won't let me do anything I want to do," I said. "I guess I'll run away". That's how mad I was.<br>
        So I packed my wagon with my favorite toys, and I packed a bag of cookies to eat on the way.<br>
        Then I walked out the front door. But my friends were going to the park to play ball. "Can you come too?" they asked.<br>
        And Mom said I could. I'll run away tomorrow if I'm still mad.<br>
