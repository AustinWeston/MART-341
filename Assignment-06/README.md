1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play? -- Documents can only have one head and one body. The head holds metadata that is not displayed on the page. It is instead interpreted by (I think) the web browser and dictates how the webpage will look and feel to the user.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup. -- Structural markup literally shapes the structure of the content on the page, such as paragraphs and lists. Semantic markup allows you to manipulate the style and look of the information (usually text) on the webpage. You can either change the font of specific text or even add extra elements to text, such as displaying a definition of a word when hovering your mouse over it.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. -- It was a mistake to do this assignment while hungry... But besides that, the content was easy to digest and was very helpful. I was able to go through the course material in one sitting and then complete the assignment without any issues. My biggest takeaway is the differences between structural and semantic markup. I am looking forward to becoming more familiar with the possibilities of semantic markup.
